1,"Ok this is awesome. Im so happy that Samsung is upgrading it's night photography and giving some focus to astrophotography as well. One of my favorite things to do is mobile astrophotography and this is looking like a serious upgrade for me. Thank you Samsung, will definitely be upgrading from my 5 year old OnePlus this year!",1.1K,2 months ago,,

28,"Base S23 could now easily be recommended as the best compact phone; with S22, battery and thermal issues were big problems that held it back from getting that title and instead the Asus Zenfone 9 got it. Now, with bigger battery, more efficient chip, and better cooling system, S23 wins that title by FAR (Zenfone 9 doesn't have telephoto lens or wireless charging, lesser update commitment, and is missing all those QOL improvements that real flagships have). Of course there's still iPhone 14 pro to consider, but a) it's $200 dollars more, b) has weaker battery and charging, c) you can't really compare iOS and Android since no one is really switching from one to another no matter how many arguments you have either way...",2,2 months ago (edited),,
29,"They're really stepping up their game in their introduction videos. Instead of having some person narrate the things that are new, they show you with people having more of a conversation in more imaginative environments.

75,Now that was epic,4,2 months ago,,
76,"I have an S8 since 2017. I waited and waited, and raised some money for a new phone. I am thinking at S23U, not sure though due to its sizes. It seems so big, but with all the new specs and camera upgrades I do think it is a good deal. I use my phone for social media, email and a lot of photos (nature mostly and family photos). My S8 battery started to show signs of getting old a few months ago. I thought of other brands as well, but I am a Samsung fan. I am thinking about S23U also because of its battery (which is bigger than the on on S23+). A lot of you mention S22U as being a good phone (no doubt about that), but I cannot say the price makes a huge difference between both of them, and taking into account the upgrades S23U has, I think it is worth it. Any suggestions?",0,2 months ago,,

83,"Though not buying it,but this introduction put a smile on me ️",4,2 months ago,,
84,"The best way to shoot quality photos with the new Samsung Galaxy S32 Ultra is to use the 50MP mode and then scale down the size to 4000 x 3000 pixels (12MP, 4:3 aspect ratio) or crop the latter to 4000 x 2250 pixels (9MP, 16:9 ratio). This results into extremely detailed photos with small file size. I'm wondering, why the ""Samsung"" engineers were not smart enough to include those two options in the phone's camera app? I used to have S21 and did the same trick with its 64MP photos that I scaled down to incredibly natural looking 9MP ones with an aspect ratio of 16:9. The default 12MP photos of S23 Ultra are oversharpened and unnatural.",0,2 months ago,,

Why on earth would they do that when selfie cameras are in many cases used more than the rear? Bored of the front cameras being neglected now. Ended up with countless fuzzy poor family shots, video calls etc. because of it. I love my S22 Ultra. This upgrade is definitely a waste of time. I'd honestly prefer them to just release a new model every 2-3 years so the upgrades between each are actually worth it. No battery upgrade in the S23 either. Again, love the Ultra series!

468,"l've been a long time Samsung user, mostly the Note series until last year when I switched to the S22 Ultra. Each year I sign up for the pre-order deals and usually end purchasing thru the ShopSamsung app instead of a carrier. Samsung usually provides a generous trade-in for the previous year's flagship. This year that's gone and switched a carrier credit trade-in over 24 months. This doesn't work for me as I usually upgrade annually. If you do trade within the 24 months, you'll lose all and have to pay full price. There's the unlockedversion that is offering was only $500. That`s not acceptable! This should be $1,000.

So we got buried in even more megapixels (which mean little as I'm sure a lot of photography pros know) and more lenses and more FPS. What happened to innovation to the ecosystem? The UI? Satellite connectivity? Emergency features? Crash detection? Faster battery charging? eSim? Anything new? Anything? I'm still rocking an S10 which does everything exactly the same way the new S23 does. Why would I change? I don't shoot Aliens:Covenant on my phone, nor do I ever intend to.

(Square icons with rounded corners, the details of the icons should be increased, the symbol of antenna and battery in the notification needs to be changed and redesigned after 17 years)
